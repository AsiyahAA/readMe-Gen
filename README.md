# readMe-Gen
## Description
### Project purpose was to generate a readme file for user input in command terminal of vs code. User would be able to input project information and a new read me file would be generated for the user with information, github link, email limk, and license badge if chosen.
## User
### User should be able to see questions regarding information of the project (such as project title, description, installation, etc) appearing and be able to answer them each. User should also be able to choose from a list of licenses to add to their readme file. User should be able to enter in their github uername and email for furthur contact information. User should then see a new read me file in the output folder with all of the information entered by user generated on the file.
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (specifically index.js) to clone started code and make other code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new JavaScript folder called index.js. Started code folders should be copied onto your own repository and inquirer version 8 should be installed using the terminal in VS code. Run the commands npm init -y, npm install inquirer@8, and then npm install to get additional files needed (such as package.jon, gitignore, etc). One all is installed, start coding and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the index.js file.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. 
### Screencastify was also used in recoridng a walk-through demostration of the readMe generator.
